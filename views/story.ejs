        <span>STORY OF <span class="our">SACHA SAUDA</span></span>
        <p>
          <b>Sacha Sauda is a revolutionary platform</b> 

          The journey of Sacha Sauda begins with the timeless teachings of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, the first Guru of Sikhism. One of the most profound lessons from his life was when he was given 20 rupees and tasked with making a profitable business. Instead of seeking material gains, he used the entire amount to feed the poor and hungry, calling it the most “Sacha Sauda” or “true deal.”
          
          This story deeply resonated with me, highlighting that the greatest profit lies in serving humanity. As I grew up witnessing the glaring disparity between food wastage and hunger in modern society, I felt compelled to connect this spiritual wisdom to a pressing real-world issue.
        </p>
        <br>
        India, celebrated for its grand weddings and vibrant food culture, generates an alarming amount of food waste, while millions go to bed hungry. Inspired by Guru Nanak Dev Ji’s teachings of compassion and service, I envisioned Sacha Sauda as a platform to redistribute surplus food to the needy, addressing hunger, minimizing waste, and promoting sustainability.
          
          Our app is more than a technological solution—it’s a bridge between spiritual values and modern challenges. By integrating Guru Nanak Dev Ji’s message with innovative practices, Sacha Sauda aims to create a society where no one sleeps hungry, food waste is minimized, and businesses embrace social responsibility.
          
          
          At Sacha Sauda, we believe that solving today’s challenges requires a blend of timeless wisdom and modern action. Together, let’s make the true deal—feeding the hungry and healing the planet.
